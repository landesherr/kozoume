# kozoume
A GameBoy emulator that aims to be barely functional

## Basic info
kozoume is developed in C99. GUI/Sound/Input will be implemented using SDL.

## The philosophy of kozoume
kozoume is not intended to work well, it is merely intended to work

The main principle that drives the development of this emulator is "Do what seems fun and convenient at the time, best practices be damned."
